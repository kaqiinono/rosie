It's not you – people haven't got the time to talk. Instead, ask to sit with classmates at lunch, in the canteen. You'll have more time. Or, go out into the playground during the break. Find people doing something that is interesting to you, and talk to them. You'll have friends in no time!\n\nGood luck,\n\nHelpMe Hal",

The Southern Cross Boarding School, in Hoedspruit, sits on a 1,100 hectare (2,700 acre) nature reserve, with many different types of wildlife including giraffes, snakes and wild boars.',
      'At Southern Cross, students work inside classrooms, just like you, but they also spend time learning in the wild. The school’s teachers feel students need a deep understanding of the natural world so that they can care for it. Teachers take students outside during all types of lessons. For example, preschool students don’t learn counting with a workbook. Instead, they go to the farm to count animals. In a language lesson, students discuss problems facing the plants and animals on the reserve. They work together to find the best solutions.',
      'Southern Cross students also enjoy activities such as rock climbing, kayaking and horse riding. Their education isn’t just about homework and exams. Students solve real-world problems, have fun and build friendships – all while learning to care for the Earth!',
      'Guess what? To get to their lessons, Southern Cross students must walk on a path that’s also used by the animals. Imagine saying ‘Good morning!’ to a passing wildebeest on the way to your morning lesson!',
